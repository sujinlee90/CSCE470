Running Tests:
==============

You will need the folder jsonfile_Chicago and recommender.py.
Running recommender.py, the console should present as a result:
Top 5 TV show recommendations for Breaking Bad (Chicago area) and some tweets about the first one.

The project is being hosted on http://csce470-rottenpotatoes.appspot.com/, but it is not attached to the Python code yet.
